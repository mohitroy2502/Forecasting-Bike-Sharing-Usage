# Forecasting-Bike-Sharing-Usage
In this project we predict the hourly demand for rental bikes and give suggestions on how to increase their revenue. We explore the data using pandas scatter matrix, seaborn violin plots. We engineer additional time features and identify outliers using seaborn box plots. We one-hot-encode qualitative features, create design matrixes and perform mult-linear regression using statsmodel OLS, R2 as metric. We use p-values to classify less significant predictors. We study the residuals using histograms and scatter plots. We also investigate polynomial and interaction terms and study the effect of multicolinearity. We implement forward-step-wise features selection and select a final model for our recommendations.

We compare Ridge with Lasso regressions with different lambdas. We study the coefficients histograms and the effect of regularization on their magnitudes.
